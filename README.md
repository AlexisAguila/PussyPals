# PussyPals
Pussypals.com is a cat dating website. Cats will be able to create their own profile and meet other cats who share their interest. Pussypals aids this by providing them with a discussion board and a proprietary cat matching algorithms which helps them match with cats of similar interest. With a beutifully designed webpage that users can interact with.

We are using flask, and sqlite to accomplish this.
